# Archive Policy

This project keeps historical research code and outputs available but outside the main agent loop.

Use this area for:
- old experiment outputs
- explainability snapshots not used by runtime
- one-off diagnostics

Do not delete historical content; move stale assets here when they are no longer part of production trading decisions.
